# TicTacToe-terminal
simple tic-tac-toe for the terminal
# how do I launch them?
Linux, Windows, macOS: python TicTacToe.py
# won't start?
perhaps you need to write python3 for this: python3 TicTacToe.py
it may be that you don't have python installed, try checking:
python --version or
python3 --version
# if there is an error, download !
